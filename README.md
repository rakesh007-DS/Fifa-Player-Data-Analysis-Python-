# ⚽ FIFA Players Data Analysis (Python Project)

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project explores the **FIFA Players Dataset** from **Kaggle**, focusing on analyzing player performance, physical attributes, and potential using **Python**.  
The goal is to gain insights into what makes players successful, how attributes evolve with age, and how clubs and countries differ in player profiles.

---

## 🧩 Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the FIFA player dataset  
- Analyze **age distribution**, **nationalities**, and **club representation**  
- Explore relationships between **Age** and key performance metrics like:
  - Stamina, Strength, Acceleration, Sprint Speed, Agility, Jumping, Vision, and Reactions  
- Study how **Age** impacts the **Overall Rating** of players  
- Identify top-performing players and trends across popular clubs and countries  

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed
1. **Data Exploration**
   - Checked dataset shape, data types, duplicates, and missing values  
   - Cleaned and formatted numerical & categorical data  

2. **Visual Analysis**
   - Histogram: Age distribution of players  
   - Regression plots: Age vs performance attributes  
   - Violin plots: Age distribution across popular **clubs** and **countries**  
   - Bar plot: Top 20 players based on Overall Rating  

3. **Sorting & Filtering**
   - Sorted players by **Age** (oldest to youngest)  
   - Filtered key columns such as *Name, Age, Nationality, Club* for reporting

## 💡 Key Insights
- Players in their **mid-20s** tend to perform best across most attributes  
- **Agility** and **Acceleration** gradually decline with age, while **Strength** remains consistent  
- Top clubs such as **FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich**, and **Liverpool** dominate player performance metrics  
- Countries like **Brazil, France, and Spain** consistently produce top-tier talent
